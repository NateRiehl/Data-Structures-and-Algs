 *Know runtime for each structure/operation in structure
 *Pros/Cons of each structure
 *To ask:
 *		Priority queue on example final
 *		Prim and kruskal on example final
 *Topics:
 *Write "is.." methods for each structure
 *112 Review:
 *		OOP
 *		GUI
 *Linear Structures:
 *
 *		List: ArrayList, LinkedList, Doubly-Linked List (Headed vs. Non-headed) 
 *		Stack -->LIFO
 *		Queue -->FIFO
 *		PriorityQueue
 *		HashTable/HashMap: Collision handling( Open/Close addressing ), hash functions
 *
 *Hierarchical Structures: Know terminology!!! 
 *		Binary Tree
 *		Binary Search Tree
 *		Balanced Tree: AVL, B-Tree --> minimum num data = ceil(degree/2) - 1
 *		Huffman Tree: Encoding, decoding, building tree
 *
 *Networked structures(Graph):
 *		Terminology: directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, adjacent, complete
 *		Representations: Adjacency matrix, Adjacency list (Neighbor-list)
 *		Searches: DFS (Similar to pre-order) / BFS (Similar to level-order)
 *		Shortest Path Algorithms: Unweighted (Count num edges to destination..modify BFS), Weighted (Djikstra Single Source,
 *			********** Floyd-Warshall all-pairs)
 * 		Minimum-Spanning Tree: Prim, Kruskal
